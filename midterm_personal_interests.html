        <h3>Intro to Comunication Studies Informative Speech on the Transformative Power of Yoga</h3>
        <hr/>
            <div>
               <p>Do you currently live your day-to-day life in a relaxed, stress-free state? Do you experience little to no pains, aches, and soreness throughout the day? Would you describe yourself as strong, grounded, balanced, and/or flexible? If you wish to answer “yes!” to any of these questions, then the power of yoga can help transform you and your everyday life. The transformative power of yoga involves the knowledge of its origins, short- and long-term benefits of the practice, and modern-day applications. Not only have I personally been doing yoga daily for over three years now, but I have had the opportunity to practice both in classes and online in the comfort of my own home. If you want to improve all aspects of your life, mind, body, and soul, and make the connection between them, then practicing yoga will help you attain this goal. To reap the benefits of yoga, you will need to know the origins of yoga, short-term effects, long-term effects, and its modern-day applications.</p> 
               <p>Let’s first dive into where, when, and how yoga originated in order to learn about its transformative power. According to Dr. Ishwa V. Basavaraddi, Yoga Scientist and Master, “Yoga is a spiritual discipline based on an extremely subtle science, which focuses on bringing harmony between mind and body”. In his article “Yoga: Its Origin, History and Development, he reveals that Yoga is believed to have originated at the beginning of civilization. Although it is seen across many different cultures and regions, India has been the primary hub for yoga’s evolution and growing community since its beginning. It is said that the Saptarishi Agastya traveled across the country to craft the “culture around a core yogic way of life”. Although Yoga is most associated with India due to its origins, it “does not adhere to any particular religion, belief system or community; it has always been approached as a technology for inner wellbeing”. More specifically, Dr. Basavaraddi explains that Yoga can be classified into four general classifications. Karma yoga, utilizes the body, while bhakti yoga utilizes the emotions. Gyana yoga, which is associated with intellect and the mind, and finally kriya yoga, which is linked to energy. Each yoga practice an individual does would fall into one or more of these categories. Moreover, it is recommended that one only practice yoga under the instruction of a Guru, who can properly combine the four fundamentals. </p>
               <p>By knowing how the practice of Yoga originated and who can practice it, participants can then reap the short-term benefits of the discipline. Numerous studies have shown short-term benefits of practicing yoga, such as increased relaxation, greater mind-body awareness, and more positive energy along with diminished negative energy. Charleen Gust, a research associate at the University of Colorado Boulder, led a study exploring yoga’s benefits on those who practice. Comparing a yoga class combining postures, breath work, mindfulness, and meditations and a posture-only class, she examined emotional regulation, self-control, distress tolerance, mindfulness, and other factors before and after practicing. It was found that such factors improved after practicing both types of yoga with minimal differences. She goes on to explain her personal experience with yoga after practicing for more than a decade and notes that the time she sets aside in the day to practice is the only time she truly feels she can disconnect and destress leaving behind things that are overwhelming and anxiety-inducing. As well as “cultivating a sense of compassion, both for myself and for others”, which I also find to be true when practicing myself. An additional study was conducted on the Impact of Short Term Yoga Intervention on Mental Well Being of Medical Students by researchers Bansal, Gupta, Agarwal, and Sharma. A group of 82 3rd semester medical students, in the age range 18-23 years-old, were assessed at the end of one month of yoga intervention. The practice was 45 minutes daily, consisting of asana (postures), pranayama (breathing), and a 10-minute meditation. The pre and post-yoga class questionnaire consisted of survey questions such as, “Have you recently been feeling perfectly well and in good health?” and “Have you recently been getting scared or panicky for no good reason?”, which had significantly decreased percentages towards the end of the study. Students reported overall improvement of general and mental well-being, specifically in four tested areas: somatic symptoms, anxiety, social dysfunction, and depression. </p>
               <p>Not only does practicing yoga have short-term benefits, but also numerous long-term benefits as well. Many long-term benefits have been found including, decreased chronic stress and related symptoms like inflammation, reduced blood pressure, balanced sympathetic (fight-or-flight) and parasympathetic (rest and digest) nervous systems, improved memory, executive functioning, and emotional resilience, altered brain structure involved in awareness, decreased reactivity in the amygdala (part of the brain that reacts to fear), and diminished anxiety and stress. Moreover, a study was conducted focusing on the long-term effects of regular yoga on physical health, specifically on yoga practitioners. The participants consisted of both men and women who were enrolled in a 1-year yoga course, whom outside the course were leading what we as Americans would consider a “normal life” as either a professional, homemaker, or student. The findings consisted of “improvement in pulmonary functions, cardiorespiratory fitness, endurance, and flexibility”. Additionally, the previously mentioned study conducted to research the Short-and long-term effects of yoga on mental health found that in the long term the participants, who practiced at least 10 minutes a day for two weeks, experienced significantly more relaxation, awareness, positive energy, and even transcendence. Thus, not only can yoga provide short-term benefits, but those short-term side effects can become long term traits if practiced for long enough.</p>
               <p>Having explored the long-term benefits of yoga, it is crucial to consider the modern-day applications of yoga as a therapeutic technique. According to Jonathan Greenberg, a PhD research fellow at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Anxiety conditions, depression, insomnia, eating disorders, and others have been treated with yoga. Moreover, it increases a sense of well-being and self-control even when applied in large populations, for example, like correctional facilities. Exploring the theraputic effects of yoga and its ability to increase quality of life, a scientific article written by Catherine Woodyard, defines Theraputic yoga as “the application of yoga postures and practice to the treatment of health conditions and involves instruction in yogic practices and teachings to prevent reduce or alleviate structural, physiological, emotional and spiritual pain, suffering or limitations”. The study found that yogic practices had a growing list of benefits when used as a therapeutic tool, including but not limited to promotion and improvement of respiratory and cardiovascular function, promotion of recovery from and treatment of addiction, reduced anxiety, depression, and chronic pain, etc. While yoga can be used as a therapeutic tool, or a “complementary health approach”, there is currently a critical gap in knowledge regarding the most optimal and ethical way to integrate it into modern-day psychological therapies. In order for yoga to be a more concrete form of therapeutic technique, there needs to be an ethical framework to guide psychologists and doctors in integrating the practice into psychotherapies. </p>
               <p>In conclusion, we have seen the transformative power of yoga from its origins in ancient India to its modern-day applications, along with its immediate benefits as well as the more long-term ones. Ancient India shaped the way for today’s world to reap all of yoga’s many helpful benefits no matter the person, place, or type of practice. Yoga practices have short-term effects such as increased relaxation, positive outlook, and improvement of general and mental well-being. Along with short-term effects are long-term effects such as decreased chronic pain and stress and their symptoms, improvement in cardiorespiratory and pulmonary functions, decreased depression and anxiety, and more. All of the numerous benefits contribute to yoga’s modern-day application as a therapeutic tool, and its future further integration into psychological practices. Through understanding its roots, short-term effects, long-term benefits, and current applications, it is evident that yoga is a timeless practice with the potential to enhance day-to-day life for anyone willing to get on the mat.</p>
